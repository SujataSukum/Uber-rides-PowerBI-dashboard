🚕 Uber Analytics: Ride Trends & Demand Insights Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Uber ride data and uncover patterns related to trip volume, time-based demand, and overall ride activity.

2. Short Description / Purpose

The Uber Analytics Dashboard is a Power BI data visualization project built to explore Uber ride data and understand ride demand trends, trip distribution, and usage patterns.
This dashboard helps transform raw ride data into clear insights using interactive visuals and filters.

3. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary tool for building reports and visualizations

📂 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created calculated measures and KPIs

🧩 Data Modeling – Structured data for better analysis and filtering

📁 File Format – .pbix for development and dashboard creation

4. Data Source

Source: Uber ride dataset (Excel file)

The dataset contains Uber trip records, including information such as:

Date and time of rides

Ride frequency

Pickup-related details

Trip distribution over time

The data was structured in tabular format and required cleaning and transformation before analysis.

5. Features / Highlights
• Business Problem

Transportation and ride-sharing platforms generate large volumes of trip data.
However, raw data makes it difficult to quickly answer questions like:

When is Uber demand highest?

How do ride patterns change over time?

What trends can be observed in trip activity?

• Goal of the Dashboard

The main goal of this dashboard is to:

Analyze Uber ride data in a visual and interactive way

Identify time-based ride demand patterns

Help users easily explore trends using filters and visuals

• Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Brief)

Key KPIs (Top Section)

Total number of Uber trips

Peak ride periods

Overall ride activity summary

Time-Based Analysis (Charts)

Ride distribution by date / time

Helps identify peak and low-demand periods

Interactive Filters / Slicers

Allows users to dynamically filter data

Makes the dashboard easy to explore and understand

Trend Visuals

Line and bar charts to observe ride patterns

Clear comparison of activity across different time frames

• Business Impact & Insights

Demand Analysis: Helps understand when Uber services are most used

Operational Insights: Useful for identifying peak usage periods

Decision Support: Demonstrates how data can support operational planning

Learning Outcome: Showcases practical use of Power BI for real-world data analysis

This project highlights my ability to clean data, build dashboards, and extract insights as a Data Analyst fresher.
